abstract = {A decline in mortality can be described as a process according to which the earlier forces of mortality become what has been defined here as the forces of debility. The main thesis is that individuals contract debilitating conditions now with the same force that used to result in deaths in the past. The difference in the two situations is that in the latter period, a certain proportion of the population can recover and thus escape death. Based on these assumptions, the relationships between the initial and the resulting life table functions have been developed in this paper. Among other things, the relative gain in life expectancy has been found to be inversely related to its initial value. Further, interesting results are obtained when a fixed proportion of the population can manage to survive a debilitating condition only once, only twice and so on. The limiting situation has been found to be equivalent to one in which the initial forces of mortality at all ages are reduced by a constant proportion.}

abstract = {Period life expectancy has increased more slowly than its cohort counterpart. This paper explores the differences between life expectancies at a given time (the gap) and the time required for period life expectancy to reach the current level of cohort life expectancy (the lag). Additionally, to understand the disparity between the two life expectancies we identify and compare age-specific contributions to change in life expectancy. Using mortality models and historical data for Sweden, we examine the effect of mortality changes over time. Our results indicate that the widening of the gap between the two life expectancies is primarily a consequence of the dramatic mortality decline at older ages that occurred during the twentieth century. These results imply that the divergence between the two measures is likely to become even greater in the future as reductions in deaths are concentrated at older ages.},

abstract = {<b>Background</b>: Some formal demographic models describe mortality improvement in terms of averted deaths. In such models individuals who would have died in an earlier regime are instead revived and returned to the population to face the same age-speciﬁc mortality risks as the rest of the population. A closely related literature has examined inequality in terms of the number of years of potential life that are lost to deaths.

<b>Objective</b>: The paper combines several results from formal demography to illustrate the potential gains in life lived from a sequence of revivals, in which everyone is revived 0, 1, 2,. . . times.

<b>Contribution</b>: Mathematical analysis yields two new results: A generalization of Vaupel and Canudas-Romo’s e† index to second and higher-order revivals, and an analytical expression that relates gains from revivals to the covariance of remaining life expectancy and cumulative mortality.},

Reliability theory deals with the effect of mean time to repair upon overall system failure rates, but for critical systems such calculations are not what is required because an important performance criterion relates to operational failures, which are fundamentally different to unsafe failures: essentially they are the result of the system-level response to avoid unsafe failures. This paper introduces the particular problem for critical systems in general, presents an analysis of some of the relevant conditions and provides some simulation results in the context of a railway active suspension application that illustrate the overall effects and trends.}

  abstract = { Enhanced knowledge on longevity and mortality in cats should support improved breeding, husbandry, clinical care and disease prevention strategies. The VetCompass research database of primary care veterinary practice data offers an extensive resource of clinical health information on companion animals in the UK. This study aimed to characterise longevity and mortality in cats, and to identify important demographic risk factors for compromised longevity. Crossbred cats were hypothesised to live longer than purebred cats. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the deceased cats. Multivariable linear regression methods investigated risk factor association with longevity in cats that died at or after 5 years of age. From 118,016 cats attending 90 practices in England, 4009 cats with confirmed deaths were randomly selected for detailed study. Demographic characterisation showed that 3660 (91.7\%) were crossbred, 2009 (50.7\%) were female and 2599 (64.8\%) were neutered. The most frequently attributed causes of mortality in cats of all ages were trauma (12.2\%), renal disorder (12.1\%), non-specific illness (11.2\%), neoplasia (10.8\%) and mass lesion disorders (10.2\%). Overall, the median longevity was 14.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 9.0–17.0; range 0.0–26.7). Crossbred cats had a higher median longevity than purebred cats (median [IQR] 14.0 years [9.1–17.0] vs 12.5 years [6.1–16.4]; P <0.001), but individual purebred cat breeds varied substantially in longevity. In cats dying at or after 5 years (n = 3360), being crossbred, having a lower bodyweight, and being neutered and non-insured were associated with increased longevity. This study described longevity in cats and identified important causes of mortality and breed-related associations with compromised longevity. },
