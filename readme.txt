These are the instructions to replicate the paper entitled:
"Who was saved more? Trends in mortality improvement through the revivorship approach"


- All data is downloaded from the Human Mortality Database. Add your username and password to download
all the data used and follow instructions on the Rcode. If you still do not have a username register 
at: https://www.mortality.org/

- Some functions are written on the very main Rcode file entitled DR_codes.R, but the main ones 
are written on the file Functions_DR. You can also find specific instructions there.

- The tables are in the folder Tables. They were written through the main code DR_codes.R but then
manually cleaned up and adapted. You can always check the manually adapted tables with the raw tables written
by R, which are usually in the first sheet of the spreadsheet files.

- In the file DR_codes.R
you can find the codes for the figures named after the order in which they appear: "Fig.1., Fig.2,...Fig.,4".
